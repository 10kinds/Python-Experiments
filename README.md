# Python-Experiments
This is a repository created to track labs and assignments for *DSCI 8133, Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State University.

## Plan
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that will interact with the file.
## About Me
My name is Michael Dickerson and I am an **Enterprise Architect** working in large-scale healthcare analytics programs for Federal Health.
My competencies include:
- Software Development
- Infrastructure Design and Scale-out
- Database Administration and Data Modeling
- Enterprise Program Management

I'm a big fan of Thomas Edison and I have built an automated payment processor called *Thomas*, a bespoke application built on APIs, that integrates with Oracle's Accounts Payable flat file process. It's a young product, so I thought it best to have a young Thomas Edison represent it.
